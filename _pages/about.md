I am a Ph.D student in Individualized Interdisciplinary Program (Robotics and Autonomous Systems) at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, under the supervision of [Prof. Ming Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CdV5LfQAAAAJ). My primary research interests include Trajectory Prediction, Deep Learning, and Robotics.

Before I joined HKUST, I obtained my M.S. degree in Mechanical Engineering in 2021 from Johns Hopkins University, advised by Prof. [Iulian I. Iordachita](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=X2Snm74AAAAJ). I graduated from Zhejiang University in Fall 2018 with a B.S. in Mechatronics Engineering.

Please feel free to contact [me](gsunah@connect.ust.hk) if you have questions about my work.
