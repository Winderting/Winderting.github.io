title: "Towards automatic robotic calibration system for flexible needles with FBG sensors"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2009-10-01-paper-title-number-1
excerpt: 'There has been much research exploring the use of fiber Bragg grating (FBG)-sensorized needles in the prostate biopsy procedure, but all FBG needles used in the research need to be calibrated, which is time consuming and prone to human errors. In this work, a semi-automatic robotic system was developed to perform FBG needle calibration. Compared to manual calibration results, the robotic system is able to calibrate FBG needles with the similar level of accuracy as achieved by an experienced manual operator, thus reducing the time cost during the needle calibration process.'
